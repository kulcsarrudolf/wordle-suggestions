An app which helps you to solve [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) puzzels created by [Josh Wardle](https://twitter.com/powerlanguish).

## ‚ö†Ô∏èWarning‚ö†Ô∏è

Do not use this app if you want the best experience that this game offers. And if you are using this app to solve the daily WORDLE, please don‚Äôt share your results on social media. Your streak can be annoying for ones who strive to solve it without any cheating, it could jeopardise some of your friendships. Trust me, some people take this game very seriously. But it can also be a good way to practise this game and to improve your English vocabulary.

## Wordle Rules

You have 6 guesses to guess the correct word.
Each guess can be any valid word.

After submitting a guess, the letters will turn gray, green, or yellow.

- Green: The letter is correct, in the correct position.
- Yellow: The letter is correct, but in the wrong position.
- Gray: The letter is incorrect.
